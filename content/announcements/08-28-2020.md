Thank you to those that came out to the infosession! A lot of points were brought that we're addressing here.

* Link to the infosession slides is [here](https://tinyurl.com/decalinfosessionslides)

* Auditors will be allowed to all of the class resources including the piazza. However, only enrolled students will have access to BCourses and the autograder. In order to compensate for this, we will send out local tests for both enrolled and auditing students.  

* All students intending to audit must submit this form in order to gain access to course content [here](https://tinyurl.com/cloudauditform).

* Confirmation email links have been sent out to all those that applied. If you applied and did not receive an email, please email the course staff at "cloudcomputingdecal@gmail.com"

* **Applications are due this Sunday, August 30th** at 11:59pm PST. Enrollment codes will be sent out this Monday (August 31st) and the first lecture will take place over Zoom this Tuesday (September 1st)

* Accomodation form will be sent out after enrollment codes are distributed.
