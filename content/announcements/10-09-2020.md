Hello everyone,

Hope you all enjoyed the resume and LinkedIn workshops! Wishing you guys luck in job hunting. Here's this week's announcements:

 - Homework 3ABC
   - We've extended the deadline for all parts of Homework 3 to tonight due to some misunderstandings. If you have not completed any part of these assignments, please do so by tonight.
 - Project Checkpoint Details
   - We've decided to release details for the checkpoint Tuesday. This is to make sure you guys have time to form pairs so make sure to have a partner by then if you're looking for one!
   - The first checkpoint will not be coding-intense but will instead require you to demonstrate your understanding of the skeleton code.
 - Project Partners
   - We'll be releasing two forms tomorrow: one for those who have a partner and another for those that are looking for one. They will both be due Monday night. Partners will be announced Tuesday.
 - AWS Educate
   - We've extended the deadline for registering to Tuesday. Get this done as soon as possible in case you run into logistical issues. This will be our last extension for signing up.

As always, make sure to take care of yourselves.

Warmly,

Your DeCal Course Staff
