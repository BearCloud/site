Hey everyone,

Hope you guys enjoyed the introduction to Networking Protocols and Golang. We'll be going into more depth and hands-on usage of HTTP and Golang beginning next week Thursday. Here's a few announcements for you guys:

1. Homework 1 has been released and can be accessed via Gradescope. It is due by end of day Tuesday. Auditors, we'll be putting it on the website later today under the "Assignments" column.

2. We will have our first guest speaker on Tuesday. It will be half-tech talk and half-Q&A, so please come up with one or two questions to ask him! Also, in order to be respectful of the speaker's time, please make sure to arrive before Berkeley time because we will be starting at 7:10 sharp.

3. We're assigning some ***highly recommended readings***/tutorials covering everything we've covered so far. This is optional, but if you feel iffy on any of these subjects, it will be helpful to at least skim them because we're assuming you're moderately familiar with all of these moving forward.
