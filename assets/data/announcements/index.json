We've got a few announcements for this coming week:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We know that last Thursday's lecture on Golang was difficult, so we'll spend the first 15-20 minutes of Tuesday's lecture reviewing Golang and web server programming. Please bring any and all questions to that lecture because we will be moving on. Here's some <strong>resources</strong> to review what we covered: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@hugo.bjarred/rest-api-with-golang-and-mux-e934f581b8b5\" target rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">golang</a> | <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_quick_guide.htm\" target rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http</a>. You do not have to read their full contents in order to understand the material, but it will be good practice to skim them and get the gist. One of the things we will emphasize in this class is quickly skimming documentation/tutorials.</li>\n<li><strong>Homework 2</strong> will be released later <strong>today (9/19)</strong> and will be <strong>due Thursday (9/24) at 11:59pm</strong>. It will consist of two components: a mandatory feedback form and a Golang + Web Server homework assignment.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedback form</strong>: We will release a feedback form link which will give you a unique token at the end. Submit this token to Gradescope for credit. <strong>(est time: 5 mins)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Golang</strong>: We will send out a Gradescope assignment that covers the basic syntax of Golang and web requests. This is not a coding assignment. <strong>(est time: 30 mins)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Office Hours</strong>: We will send out a post later today detailing our office hours availability.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lastly, if you feel overwhelmed by the pacing of this course, <em>please</em> reach out to us so we can figure out ways to help you get up to speed. We want everyone to get as much as possible out of this course and are willing to work with you. Take care and stay safe.</p>\n<p>Warmly,</p>\n<p>Your DeCal Course Staff</p>\n","path":"/announcements/09-19-2020/"}},{"node":{"id":"157797ae48721e12e345a14ed5516b6d","title":"Week 2","date":"2020-09-11","content":"<p>Hey everyone,</p>\n<p>Hope you guys enjoyed the introduction to Networking Protocols and Golang.

Auditors, we'll be putting it on the website later today under the \"Assignments\" column.</li>\n<li>We will have our first guest speaker on Tuesday. It will be half-tech talk and half-Q&#x26;A, so please come up with one or two questions to ask him! Also, in order to be respectful of the speaker's time, please make sure to arrive before Berkeley time because we will be starting at 7:10 sharp.</li>\n<li>We're assigning some <strong><em>highly recommended readings</em></strong>/tutorials covering everything we've covered so far.

We have a few logistical announcements for you guys:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All enrollment codes have been sent out. If you received your enrollment code, add the course on Calcentral by Monday, September 7, because that is when we will be pulling our official roster to Gradescope and also when we will be assigning the first homework assignment. If you did not receive an enrollment code, make a private Piazza post immediately.</li>\n<li>We'd like to do everything we can to help make this class a better experience for you, so please fill out the optional anonymous check-in for week 1 (link is on Piazza). It would really help us gauge where we (the instructors) are and allow us to better deliver the course content, especially because this is the first iteration of the DeCal.</li>\n<li>Because we reopened our application while the first few lectures were running, we have waived the attendance requirement for this past week only. We very highly recommend watching at least Thursday's lecture because you will be responsible for knowing it when we begin teaching Golang and SQL.</li>\n<li>If you felt a bit overwhelmed during our Command Line and Git lecture, don't sweat! We will be compiling all the commands we used in the lecture into a document with a breakdown of how commands work as well as how to take our conceptual knowledge of Git and apply our hands-on knowledge. The commands will be there for reference so you don't need to memorize it, but you'll soon have them down through muscle memory.</li>\n</ol>\n","path":"/announcements/09-05-2020/"}},{"node":{"id":"fe5e3003a8c1776084c874f9a411914c","title":"Reopened apps","date":"2020-08-31","content":"<p>We've reopened our apps until <strong>Friday, September 4th!</strong> Make sure to apply soon!</p>\n<p>Apply at <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/cloudcomputingdecal\" target rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://tinyurl.com/cloudcomputingdecal</a></p>\n","path":"/announcements/08-31-2020/"}},{"node":{"id":"a88602404e50a16be47825171cd04f9a","title":"Infosession","date":"2020-08-28","content":"<p>Thank you to those that came out to the infosession!
