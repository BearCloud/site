    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      The popularity of Cloud Computing and Saas has gained significant traction over the past few years and the demand for experienced engineers in the field is ever-increasing. The Cloud Computing and SaaS Decal aims to bridge the gap between traditional computer science coursework and hands-on experience in the software industry. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This course takes a very practical and hands-on approach to learning, with the mini-projects being the primary tools for reinforcing lecture content. It is designed to serve as a complement to popular software application oriented courses such as CS162, CS186, and CS169.
    </p>
    <h4>Content Rundown</h4>
    <p>
      The course will begin by covering the general definitions of cloud computing and software as a service. There will be workshops for essential tools such as Git, the command line, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. We will also be inviting many guest speakers/lecturers that currently work in industry to speak about their knowledge and provide a practical demonstration. The mini-projects cumulate into one final project that encompasses a full-stack web application that runs in the cloud. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the course, students will learn of prominent cloud computing service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, and develop fluency in their fundamental service offerings. They will also be familiarized with common tools and concepts used heavily in industry and will be better prepared for industry interviews, internships, and full-time jobs.
    </p>
    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>

    <h4>Inform Course Staff of Any Accommodations Needed</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of academic accommodations is to ensure that all students have a fair chance at academic success. If you have Letters of Accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program or another authorized office, please share them with me as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements. While individual circumstances can vary, requests for accommodations often fall into the categories listed on the Academic Calendar and Accommodations website. The campus has well-developed processes in place for students to request accommodations, and you are encouraged to contact the relevant campus offices listed on the Academic Accommodations Hub(link is external). These offices, some of which are confidential, can offer support, answer questions about your eligibility and rights, and request accommodations on your behalf, while maintaining your privacy.
    </p>
    <h4>Statement on Classroom Climate</h4>
    <p>
      We are all responsible for creating a learning environment that is welcoming, inclusive, equitable, and respectful. The expectation in this class is that we all live up to this responsibility, even during vigorous debate or disagreement, and that we will intervene if exclusionary or harassing behavior occurs. If you feel that these expectations are not being met, you can consult your instructors or seek assistance from campus resources.
